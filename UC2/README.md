## How to connect

### VPN

Get a VPN access to the cluster from Dell. There is no direct connectivity without VPN.

### DNS workaround

Our Kubernetes cluster has no DNS set up yet. To override it, add to your [hosts file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_(file)) the following configurations:

```
10.14.2.5 argocd.uc2
10.14.2.5 metadata.uc2
```

## Initial configuration

### Traffic routing

The diagram demonstrates traffic routing from web client to application running in cluster.

Ingress controller is mapped to a master node port 31080. It is not the best practice. We use this approach for a quick start. Consider to use the best practices.

Load balancer is a manually installed Nginx. Check [load-balancer](load-balancer) for more details.

### ArgoCD

How to install ArgoCD.

1. Follow official [docs](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/).
2. Apply `argocd-*.yaml` configmaps of our custom configuration.
   ```
   $ kubectl apply -f "argocd-*.yaml" -n=argocd
   ```
3. Use *.yaml as App-of-Apps configurations.
